        "description": "This thesis investigates the behavior of a unique car suspension system. Instead of traditional coil springs, it uses a specially shaped component to create the spring effect, which is why it's called \"geometrically induced.\" The system is \"non-linear,\" meaning its response isn't simple and proportional, which often makes it more complex but potentially more effective. The study will primarily use computer simulations and mathematical calculations (\"numerical analysis\") to understand how this innovative suspension absorbs bumps and vibrations. The goal is to design and analyze a system that could offer better ride comfort or handling characteristics by harnessing these non-linear properties."

        "description": "This thesis explores the impact of a unique insert on how efficiently heat is transferred within a system, likely a heat exchanger. The \"perforated twisted tape\" is a specially designed strip with holes, twisted to encourage fluid mixing, while the \"conical ring\" likely helps guide the fluid flow and further enhance turbulence. The research will experimentally investigate how these features, when combined, affect the \"performance of heat transfer,\" meaning how well heat moves from one place to another. This study aims to improve the effectiveness of cooling or heating processes by enhancing fluid movement and heat exchange, ultimately contributing to more efficient heat exchanger designs and potentially better cooling systems."
